Our directory is split into our assets, CSS, data files, javscript files, and the index.html page.

Our 'assets' folder is where we have all the images that are used in the page. The timeline assets are split into their own folder, while the rest of the folder includes the other image assets.

The 'css' folder holds our main style.css document. This is the only css document for our entire page.

The 'data' folder holds our data files, which are primarily in .csv format. We also have one .json file for map information

The 'js' folder holds all of the javascript files for our visualizations. Main.js acts as a controller to load all of the visualizations.

The '.idea' folder holds libraries that are used to load the visualization systems.
